# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, experimentation, and documentation of the Human Behavior Drift Detection System.

## Expected Notebooks:
- `01_data_exploration.ipynb` - Initial data exploration and visualization
- `02_feature_engineering.ipynb` - Feature extraction and engineering experiments
- `03_drift_detection_analysis.ipynb` - Drift detection algorithm testing
- `04_model_development.ipynb` - ML model training and evaluation
- `05_risk_scoring.ipynb` - Risk scoring methodology development
- `06_visualization.ipynb` - Creating visualizations and reports

## Best Practices:
- Use clear, descriptive notebook names with numbering
- Include markdown cells explaining the analysis
- Keep notebooks focused on a single topic
- Export final results and insights to reports
- Clear output cells before committing

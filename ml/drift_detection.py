Drift Detection Module

This module implements drift detection algorithms for the Human Behavior Drift Detection System.
It identifies when collective behavior patterns deviate significantly from historical baselines.

Key functionalities:
- Statistical drift detection methods (e.g., KS test, Chi-square test)
- Distribution comparison algorithms
- Concept drift detection
- Data drift detection
- Real-time drift monitoring
- Drift visualization and reporting
